This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify chest X-ray images into three categories: Covid, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes training and testing folders for each class. The model is trained, evaluated, and used for prediction on new images. Performance is visualized using accuracy/loss curves and saved for future use.
